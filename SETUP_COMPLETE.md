# 🎉 Local Setup Complete!

Your Brown Course Catalog app is now fully set up for local development with real data!

## ✅ What's Working

### 🗄️ Database
- **Local PostgreSQL** database: `brown_course_catalog_local`
- **1,208 real Brown University courses** loaded from the SQL file
- **Professor information** properly displayed on course cards
- **User accounts** with password hashing and JWT authentication

### 🔐 Authentication
- **User registration** creates real accounts in the database
- **Password verification** using bcrypt hashing
- **JWT tokens** for secure authentication
- **Test user**: `test@brown.edu` / `password123`

### 📚 Course Data
- **Real Brown University courses** with professor names
- **Course search** by name, code, description, or professor
- **Schedule management** with time conflict detection
- **User profiles** with name updates and password changes

### 🚀 Development Environment
- **Single command startup**: `npm run dev`
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173 (or 5174)
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3001
- **Local database**: No external dependencies

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

1. ✅ **Professors showing up**: Course cards now display professor information from database
2. ✅ **User registration**: Signup creates real accounts in local database  
3. ✅ **Password verification**: Proper bcrypt hashing and verification
4. ✅ **Data persistence**: All data saved to local PostgreSQL database
5. ✅ **Local development**: No external dependencies or deployment services

## 🚀 How to Run
