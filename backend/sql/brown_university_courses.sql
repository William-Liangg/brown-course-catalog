('AFRI 0410', 'After the Uprisings: Abolition and Black Studies', 'This small, discussion-based seminar will examine the concept of “abolition” and its relationship to Black Studies. In the aftermath of the uprisings of 2020, abolition has become part of popular discourse in ways hardly imagined by some of its theorists and practitioners. The framework is most often aimed at carceral structures such as police, prisons, and surveillance, yet some interpretations of abolition take aim at the state, borders, and even the world. This seminar will explore the varied discourses of abolition and invite students to wrestle with the theoretical and practical difficulties the framework is confronted with, such as questions of law, politics, gender, and temporality. A key site of inquiry will be the methods of struggle proposed to get from the present to the anticipated abolitionist future. What “pathways to abolition” are prioritized, while others fall off the table?', 'T', '16:00:00', '18:30:00', 'Churchill House 206', 'Justin Lang'),

We will also explore various community and policy strategies to address race-based arrest and incarceration rates pre-legalization, race and gender-based differences in licensing programs for cannabis entrepreneurs, and the health impacts of cannabis processing plant placements which tend to be heavily clustered in poor, urban communities of color. We will invite local elected officials, nonprofit groups working on the topics, dispensary founders from the local area, and hopefully, cannabis funders and entrepreneurs to provide us with first-hand perspectives.', 'MWF', '09:00:00', '09:50:00', 'List Art Center 120', 'Noliwe Rooks'),
('AFRI 0670', 'Global Black Radicalism', 'The decade from the mid-Sixties until the mid-Seventies witnessed the rise of Black Radicalism as a global phenomenon. The emergence of Black Power in the US, Brazil and the Caribbean, the consolidation of liberation struggles in Portuguese Africa and the rise of a Black Consciousness trend in Apartheid South Africa all represent key moments. What led young activists to embrace “Black Power?” What led to the emergence of Marxist movements in Portuguese Africa? What events in the Caribbean gave ascendancy to radical tendencies?

Beginning with settler colonialism and the frontier myth and ending with notions of queer ecology and the supercrip narrative, this course builds upon the canon of eco-arts through encompassing a range of perspectives and methodological approaches. By putting contemporary theories of nature and identity (race, gender, sexuality, disability, etc.) in conversation with art, students will gain a comprehensive view of how humans’ view of nature has shifted over time and who does or does not “fit” in nature according to the American public imaginary.', 'Th', '16:00:00', '18:30:00', 'Page-Robinson Hall 502', 'Lindsay Garcia'),
('AMST 0170G', 'Native American Boarding School Histories', 'Native American boarding schools, whose institutional motto was: “Kill the Indian, Save the Man,” were implemented as part the official US Federal Indian Policy in the late 1800s. This sophomore seminar highlights both the histories of these schools and their contemporary reverberations, especially as it has recently culminated in several organizing gains. Throughout this course students will trace the emergence of boarding schools as an integral component of settler colonialism. Students will also gain an understanding of settler colonialism as a structure that continues to dispossess Indigenous people from their lands, resources, and knowledges. As such, it is important to contextualize the boarding school system as a tool oriented toward achieving these same goals.', 'M', '15:00:00', '17:30:00', '101 Thayer Street (VGQ 1st fl) 116E', 'Jessica Fremland'),

It is organized around two interpretive spines, each of which follows an evolving American dilemma. One, looking at struggles over the shape of the “we” in “we the people,” takes on the theme of inclusion and exclusion in the body politic. The other concerns the changing fate of American ideals of independence and self-possession in the face of a rapidly developing interdependent capitalist economy and mass culture. Students will work to understand how these themes—the “us and them” and the “me versus we"—are interconnected.', 'TTh', '13:00:00', '14:20:00', 'Barus & Holley 165', 'Samuel Zipp'),

('AMST 1907F', 'Queer Indigenous Studies and Two-Spirit Critique', 'The structures of settler colonialism are designed to wholly dispossess, erase, and eliminate the fullness of Indigenous life. As such settler colonialism is heavily invested in both heteropatriarchy and heteronormativity as regulatory schemes oriented toward extraction and conquest. Through a series of theoretical readings, poetry, and literature, this Senior Seminar will explore the unruly “queerness” of Indigeneity. During this course students will develop a keen understanding of the ways concepts such as relationality and (in)humanness are co-constitutive of a queer Indigenous analytic, while also learning how settler colonialism has impacted contemporary understandings of gender and sexuality. Students will explore the complexities of two-spirit identity through memoirs and reflective media, while also cultivating knowledge of two-spirit organizing efforts and theoretical interventions within the field of Native American and Indigenous Studies.', 'T', '16:00:00', '18:30:00', 'Page-Robinson Hall 503', 'Jessica Fremland'),

Using a broad understanding of politics, we will examine how arrangements of power become naturalized through culture, and how people differently sustain, reproduce, resist, and contest these dynamics. With a particular focus on social movements, we will examine the circumstances under which people politically mobilize understandings of gender and sexuality, and how these mobilizations relate to issues like marginalization, migration, colonialism, and capitalism. Our broader aim will be to grasp how gender and sexuality-based inequalities produce—and are produced by—forms of political exclusion, as well as the diverse ways people work to engage, and even transform, existing structures of power.', 'TTh', '13:00:00', '14:20:00', '111 Thayer St-Watson Institute 138', 'Alex Wolff'),

Viewing the state as a material abstraction (a complex sign) rather than as an absolute entity, we turn to theories of differentiation in circulation and movement. We attempt to answer the questions: What is movement? What moves? And what does movement create, break down, and change? Thinking about the implications of such questions, we will consider the extent to which differentiations in movement carve out units of governance, how the differences produced in those units might generate change, and how forms of difference might partially escape and alter such movement (or not).', 'Th', '16:00:00', '18:30:00', 'Giddings House 114', 'Michael Berman'),

We will ask how these concepts have been used and abused in efforts to undo the harms which humans do to other humans, and to the world they inhabit and share.
