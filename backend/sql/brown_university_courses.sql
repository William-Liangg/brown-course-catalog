('AFRI 0410', 'After the Uprisings: Abolition and Black Studies', 'This small, discussion-based seminar will examine the concept of “abolition” and its relationship to Black Studies. In the aftermath of the uprisings of 2020, abolition has become part of popular discourse in ways hardly imagined by some of its theorists and practitioners. The framework is most often aimed at carceral structures such as police, prisons, and surveillance, yet some interpretations of abolition take aim at the state, borders, and even the world. This seminar will explore the varied discourses of abolition and invite students to wrestle with the theoretical and practical difficulties the framework is confronted with, such as questions of law, politics, gender, and temporality. A key site of inquiry will be the methods of struggle proposed to get from the present to the anticipated abolitionist future. What “pathways to abolition” are prioritized, while others fall off the table?', 'T', '16:00:00', '18:30:00', 'Churchill House 206', 'Justin Lang'),

('AMST 0170G', 'Native American Boarding School Histories', 'Native American boarding schools, whose institutional motto was: “Kill the Indian, Save the Man,” were implemented as part the official US Federal Indian Policy in the late 1800s. This sophomore seminar highlights both the histories of these schools and their contemporary reverberations, especially as it has recently culminated in several organizing gains. Throughout this course students will trace the emergence of boarding schools as an integral component of settler colonialism. Students will also gain an understanding of settler colonialism as a structure that continues to dispossess Indigenous people from their lands, resources, and knowledges. As such, it is important to contextualize the boarding school system as a tool oriented toward achieving these same goals.', 'M', '15:00:00', '17:30:00', '101 Thayer Street (VGQ 1st fl) 116E', 'Jessica Fremland'),

('ANTH 0301', 'Gender and Politics', 'In this course we will focus on how gender and sexuality relate to people’s involvement in political processes at a transnational scale—closely examining their intimacy with areas of difference like race, ethnicity, religion, class, and nation. Using a broad understanding of politics, we will examine how arrangements of power become naturalized through culture, and how people differently sustain, reproduce, resist, and contest these dynamics. With a particular focus on social movements, we will examine the circumstances under which people politically mobilize understandings of gender and sexuality, and how these mobilizations relate to issues like marginalization, migration, colonialism, and capitalism. Our broader aim will be to grasp how gender and sexuality-based inequalities produce—and are produced by—forms of political exclusion, as well as the diverse ways people work to engage, and even transform, existing structures of power.', 'TTh', '13:00:00', '14:20:00', '111 Thayer St-Watson Institute 138', 'Alex Wolff'),

Rather than seeing the State as a fixed, absolute entity that exists on a separate plane of existence, this course analyzes the state as an effect-producing abstraction that arises in contested circulations of meaningful signs. Viewing the state as a material abstraction (a complex sign) rather than as an absolute entity, we turn to theories of differentiation in circulation and movement. We attempt to answer the questions: What is movement? What moves? And what does movement create, break down, and change? Thinking about the implications of such questions, we will consider the extent to which differentiations in movement carve out units of governance, how the differences produced in those units might generate change, and how forms of difference might partially escape and alter such movement (or not).', 'Th', '16:00:00', '18:30:00', 'Giddings House 114', 'Michael Berman'),
