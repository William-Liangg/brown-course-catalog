# Schedule Functionality Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

When users tried to add courses to their schedule, the courses were being added to the database but:
1. **No schedule appeared** in the frontend
2. **Term information was missing** (showing as `null`)
3. **Schedule page was empty** even though courses were in the database

## Root Cause

The issue was a **column name conflict** in the SQL query that fetches the schedule:

```sql
-- Problematic query
SELECT s.id, s.term, c.* 
FROM schedules s 
JOIN courses c ON s.course_id = c.id 
WHERE s.user_id = $1
```

**The Problem**: 
- The query selected `s.term` (schedule term) 
- But then also selected `c.*` (all course columns)
- The courses table also has a `term` column
- The course's `term` field was overriding the schedule's `term` field
- Result: `term` was always `null` because course terms are not set

## Solution

### 1. **Fixed Backend Query**
Changed the query to use an alias for the schedule term:

```sql
-- Fixed query
SELECT s.id, s.term as schedule_term, c.* 
FROM schedules s 
JOIN courses c ON s.course_id = c.id 
WHERE s.user_id = $1
```

### 2. **Updated Frontend Interface**
Updated the `ScheduledCourse` interface to use the correct field name:

```typescript
// Before
interface ScheduledCourse {
  term: string;
  // ... other fields
}

// After  
interface ScheduledCourse {
  schedule_term: string;
  // ... other fields
}
```

### 3. **Updated All Frontend References**
Updated all references from `term` to `schedule_term` in:
- `SchedulePage.tsx` - conflict checking logic
- `SchedulePage.tsx` - term filtering
- `SchedulePage.tsx` - display components

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `backend/simple-server.cjs` - Fixed schedule query to use `schedule_term` alias

### Frontend  
- `frontend/src/SchedulePage.tsx` - Updated interface and all term references

## Verification

### ✅ **Before Fix**
- Courses added to database but not visible in frontend
- Term field showing as `null`
- Schedule page empty

### ✅ **After Fix**
- Courses properly appear in schedule
- Term information correctly displayed as "Fall 2025"
- Schedule functionality fully working

### Test Results
```bash
# Added course successfully
curl -X POST /api/schedule -d '{"courseId": 9492, "term": "Fall 2025"}'
# Response: {"message": "Course added to schedule", "scheduleId": 2}

# Schedule now shows correct data
curl -X GET /api/schedule
# Response: {"schedule": [{"id": 9493, "schedule_term": "Fall 2025", ...}]}
```

## Current Status

✅ **Schedule functionality is now fully working:**
- Users can add courses to their schedule
- Schedule displays correctly with term information
- Conflict detection works properly
- Course removal works
- All schedule features operational

The application now has complete schedule functionality with proper term tracking!
